# techdegree-project-5-Interactive-Photo-Gallery

This is my 5th project in the Team Treehouse Front-End techdegree.

In this project I have to make an Interactive Photo gallery using HTML CSS JavaScript. I utilized the JavaScript plugin Lightbox in order to make images overlay when actived. I then added a search box to filter through photo captions.
